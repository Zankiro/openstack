OpenStack Tracking Repo
=======================


zuul gates all of the contained projects in an effective single
timeline. This means that OpenStack, across all of the projects, does
already have a sequence of combinations that have been explicitly
tested, but it's non-trivial to go from a single commit of a particular
project to the commits that were tested with it.

Gerrit's submodule tracking feature will update a super project every
time a subproject is updated, so the specific sequence created by zuul
will be captured by the super project commits.

This repo is intended to be used in a read-only manner. Any commit in this
repo will get a collection of commits in the other repos that have
explicitly been tested with each other, if that sort of thing is important
to you.
